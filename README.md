# hello-world
An introduction to GitHub
I am Emmanuel Ezenwere, I don't know the appropriate name for my goal profession but I know it involves Machine-learning, Neuroscience, artificial-intelligence and finally robotics perhaps the appropriate name should be a roboticist either way that's what I want to be. Currently I am in phase 1.
